things i've learned through this project

1. sqlite3 "select" returns a list of tuples
2. sqlite3 "select" requires the second argument to be a tuple
2. a tuple is an immutable list.
3. cs50 sql "select" returns a list of dicts, where the key = columnheadername
    - far more useful and intuitive to access a list of dicts rather than a list if tuples
    - pandas can turn list of tuples/dicts into a dataframe (better with list of dicts due to preservation of column headers)
4. pandas/matplotlib for generating and saving plots
5. general javascript stuff
6. general html stuff
7. session[keyname] is a module that gives you a variable that allows you to store a value across multiple flask routes 
8. general sql stuff
    -use (?, ?) as placeholders for your variables unless you want to be vulnerable to sql injection
9. a workspace is ??? something i dont understand
10. a virtual environment is ??? something i dont understand
11. I had to do pip install module_name for some modules, whilst others could just be imported
12. images are cached when you load a webpage
    - if you want to display an image with fixed filename, but dynamic content, you have to trick the image caching system
    - aka Cache-busting
